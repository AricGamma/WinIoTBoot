/**
  Interface structure for the Watchdog Architectural Protocol.

  @par Protocol Description:
  This protocol provides a service to set the amount of time to wait
  before firing the watchdog timer, and it also provides a service to
  register a handler that is invoked when the watchdog timer fires.

  @par When the watchdog timer fires, control will be passed to a handler
  if one has been registered.  If no handler has been registered,
  or the registered handler returns, then the system will be
  reset by calling the Runtime Service ResetSystem().

  @param RegisterHandler
  Registers a handler that will be called each time the
  watchdogtimer interrupt fires.  TimerPeriod defines the minimum
  time between timer interrupts, so TimerPeriod will also
  be the minimum time between calls to the registered
  handler.
  NOTE: If the watchdog resets the system in hardware, then
        this function will not have any chance of executing.

  @param SetTimerPeriod
  Sets the period of the timer interrupt in 100 nS units.
  This function is optional, and may return EFI_UNSUPPORTED.
  If this function is supported, then the timer period will
  be rounded up to the nearest supported timer period.

  @param GetTimerPeriod
  Retrieves the period of the timer interrupt in 100 nS units.
