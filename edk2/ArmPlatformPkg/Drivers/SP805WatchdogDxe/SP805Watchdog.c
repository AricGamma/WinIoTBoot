  If NotifyFunction is NULL, and a handler is already registered,

  If an attempt is made to unregister a handler when a handler is not registered,
  then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned.

  @param  NotifyFunction   The function to call when a timer interrupt fires. This
                           function executes at TPL_HIGH_LEVEL. The DXE Core will
                           register a handler for the timer interrupt, so it can know
                           how much time has passed. This information is used to
                           signal timer based events. NULL will unregister the handler.

  This function adjusts the period of timer interrupts to the value specified
  by TimerPeriod.  If the timer period is updated, then the selected timer
  period is stored in EFI_TIMER.TimerPeriod, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned.  If
  the timer hardware is not programmable, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.
  If an error occurs while attempting to update the timer period, then the
  timer hardware will be put back in its state prior to this call, and
  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR is returned.  If TimerPeriod is 0, then the timer interrupt
  is disabled.  This is not the same as disabling the CPU's interrupts.
  Instead, it must either turn off the timer hardware, or it must adjust the
  interrupt controller so that a CPU interrupt is not generated when the timer
  interrupt fires.

  @param  This             The EFI_TIMER_ARCH_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  TimerPeriod      The rate to program the timer interrupt in 100 nS units. If

                           returned. If the timer is programmable, then the timer period
                           will be rounded up to the nearest timer period that is supported
                           by the timer hardware. If TimerPeriod is set to 0, then the

/**
  Interface structure for the Watchdog Architectural Protocol.

  @par Protocol Description:
  This protocol provides a service to set the amount of time to wait
  before firing the watchdog timer, and it also provides a service to
  register a handler that is invoked when the watchdog timer fires.

  @par When the watchdog timer fires, control will be passed to a handler
  if one has been registered.  If no handler has been registered,
  or the registered handler returns, then the system will be
  reset by calling the Runtime Service ResetSystem().

  @param RegisterHandler
  Registers a handler that will be called each time the
  watchdogtimer interrupt fires.  TimerPeriod defines the minimum
  time between timer interrupts, so TimerPeriod will also
  be the minimum time between calls to the registered
  handler.
  NOTE: If the watchdog resets the system in hardware, then
        this function will not have any chance of executing.

  @param SetTimerPeriod
  Sets the period of the timer interrupt in 100 nS units.
  This function is optional, and may return EFI_UNSUPPORTED.
  If this function is supported, then the timer period will
  be rounded up to the nearest supported timer period.

  @param GetTimerPeriod
  Retrieves the period of the timer interrupt in 100 nS units.
