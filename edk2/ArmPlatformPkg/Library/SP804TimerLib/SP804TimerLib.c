/**
  Stalls the CPU for at least the given number of microseconds.

  Stalls the CPU for the number of microseconds specified by MicroSeconds.
  The hardware timer is 32 bits.
  The maximum possible delay is (0xFFFFFFFF / TimerFrequencyMHz), i.e. ([32bits] / FreqInMHz)
  For example:
  +----------------+------------+----------+----------+
  | TimerFrequency |  MaxDelay  | MaxDelay | MaxDelay |
  |     (MHz)      |    (us)    |   (s)    |  (min)   |
  +----------------+------------+----------+----------+
  |        1       | 0xFFFFFFFF |   4294   |   71.5   |
  |        5       | 0x33333333 |    859   |   14.3   |
  |       10       | 0x19999999 |    429   |    7.2   |
  |       50       | 0x051EB851 |     86   |    1.4   |
  +----------------+------------+----------+----------+
  If it becomes necessary to support higher delays, then consider using the
  real time clock.

  During this delay, the cpu is not yielded to any other process, with one exception:
  events that are triggered off a timer and which execute at a higher TPL than
  this function. These events may call MicroSecondDelay (or NanoSecondDelay) to
  fulfil their own needs.
  Therefore, this function must be re-entrant, as it may be interrupted and re-started.

  @param  MicroSeconds  The minimum number of microseconds to delay.

  @return The value of MicroSeconds inputted.
