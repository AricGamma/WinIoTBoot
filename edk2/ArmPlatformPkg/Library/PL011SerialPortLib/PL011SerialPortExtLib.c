/**
  Set new attributes to PL011.

  @param  BaudRate                The baud rate of the serial device. If the baud rate is not supported,
                                  the speed will be reduced down to the nearest supported one and the
                                  variable's value will be updated accordingly.
  @param  ReceiveFifoDepth        The number of characters the device will buffer on input. If the specified
                                  value is not supported, the variable's value will be reduced down to the
                                  nearest supported one.
  @param  Timeout                 If applicable, the number of microseconds the device will wait
                                  before timing out a Read or a Write operation.
  @param  Parity                  If applicable, this is the EFI_PARITY_TYPE that is computed or checked
                                  as each character is transmitted or received. If the device does not
                                  support parity, the value is the default parity value.
  @param  DataBits                The number of data bits in each character
  @param  StopBits                If applicable, the EFI_STOP_BITS_TYPE number of stop bits per character.
                                  If the device does not support stop bits, the value is the default stop
                                  bit value.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             All attributes were set correctly on the serial device.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETERS  One or more of the attributes has an unsupported value.
