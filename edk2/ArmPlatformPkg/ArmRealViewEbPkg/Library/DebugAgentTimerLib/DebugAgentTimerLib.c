  Template for ArmEb DebugAgentLib. 

  For ARM we reserve FIQ for the Debug Agent Timer. We don't care about 
  laytency as we only really need the timer to run a few times a second 
  (how fast can some one type a ctrl-c?), but it works much better if
  the interrupt we are using to break into the debugger is not being
  used, and masked, by the system.
